      "text": "Think of memory as a long row of numbered boxes. Each box can hold a value, and each has an address, which is its position in that long line. When you create a variable in C, you reserve one of those boxes for you and give it a name so you can find it later."

      "text": "For example, when you write `int age = 20;`, you’re creating a box big enough to hold a whole number (known as an integer), and storing the number 20 inside it. The name age is just a label, something humans use to remember which box we’re talking about. The program doesn’t care about the name but only remembers the address."

If you print it again or perform math on it, the computer goes back to that same spot in memory, retrieves the value, and uses it in the calculation."
