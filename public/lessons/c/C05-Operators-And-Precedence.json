      "text": "Operators are small symbols like +, -, *, /, which gets the program to do math on numbers. For example, 3 + 2 adds two numbers, while 6 / 3 divides one by the other. Unlike on paper, multiplication is denoted via *, rather than an x, or a dot. C also has comparison operators like == and >, which return true or false (1 or 0) depending on the relationship between values."

      "text": "Intuitively, just like BODMAS or PEMDAS on paper, not all operators have the same priority. When you write a more complex expression, like 3 + 2 * 4, C doesn’t read it strictly left to right. It follows a set of rules called precedence to decide which operations happen first. In that example, multiplication has higher precedence, so 2 * 4 runs before the addition. The result is 11, not 20."
