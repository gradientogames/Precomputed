      "text": "Memory alignment ensures that data is stored at addresses that match its type's requirements. For example, a 4-byte integer is typically aligned on a 4-byte boundary. Proper alignment allows the CPU to access data efficiently, reducing memory access time and avoiding potential crashes on some architectures."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Padding is extra space the compiler inserts between members of a struct to maintain alignment. This can cause the size of a struct to be larger than the sum of its member sizes. Understanding alignment and padding helps optimize memory usage and prevents unexpected behavior when working with low-level memory operations."
