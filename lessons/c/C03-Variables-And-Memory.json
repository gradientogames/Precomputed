      "text": "Think of memory as a long row of numbered boxes, stored in your RAM. Each box can hold a value, and each has an address, which is its position in that long line. When you create a variable in C, you reserve one of those boxes and give it a name so you can find it later."

      "text": "For example, when you write `int age = 20;`, you’re creating a box big enough to hold a whole number (known as an integer), and storing the number 20 inside it. The name `age` is just a label, something we use to remember which box we’re talking about. The program itself doesn't store the name, only remembering the address."
